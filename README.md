# "Bullet" physics for node.js

## The Basics
* Only works on linux at the moment
* Very limited binding types
* Requires bullet to be built in /libbullet with libbullet_build.sh
* Bullet is statically linked into the module

## Notes to self
* Full reset with git fetch --all; git reset --hard origin/master
* Build with node-gyp configure && node-gyp build -v
